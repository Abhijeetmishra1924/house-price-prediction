# house-price-prediction
This house price prediction project aims to develop a reliable machine learning model capable of estimating residential property prices based on a comprehensive set of housing features. Using the well-known "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 80 attributes describing homes in Ames, Iowa, the project focuses on building an end-to-end solution that transforms raw data into actionable predictions. The primary objective is to analyze key factors—such as overall quality, living area, year built, garage size, and neighborhood—that significantly influence a home's market value, and to train a regression model that accurately captures the relationship between these features and the sale price. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Random Forest regression, the model learns from historical sales data to make predictions on unseen properties. The final application is deployed as an interactive web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input property details and instantly receive a predicted price.
